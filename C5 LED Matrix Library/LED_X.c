/*
 * MCU: ATtiny2313
 * We use the display_image function to display a desired shape on the LED matrix. 
 
 * Send 16 bits at a time: first 4 are Don't Cares. next 4 are ADDRESS. and then 8 DATA bits.
 * The 4 ADDRESS bits allow us to choose a column, and then the 8 DATA bits represent which of the 8 LEDs in that column are on/off 
 * However, before we can control the LEDs, we must initialize the LED Matrix:
 * Upon powering up, we're in shutdown mode and only scan 1 digit (i.e only the leftmost column can be controlled).
 * To initialize: Leave shutdown mode (i.e. enter Normal Operation mode), then set Scan Limit to digits 0 to 7. This way, we can control all the columns.
